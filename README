First decompile the dictionary to a tab file.
Run `remove-diacritics.sh` to remove the diacritics from the keywords.
Run `transliterate.sh` to transliterate the keywords. The keywords MUST be diacritics-less.
To compile dictionary with duplicate keywords you need to have `stardict-tools (<< 3.0.2) | stardict-tools (>= 3.0.5)`
